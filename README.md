This project provides an in-depth exploration of the fundamental principles of transmission lines and electromagnetic interference through advanced computational simulations performed in Scilab, offering a strong integration of theoretical understanding and practical experimentation. It focuses on analyzing key parameters such as the reflection coefficient (Γ), standing wave ratio (SWR), and input impedance (Zin), and visualizes them effectively through Smith Charts to illustrate how impedance mismatches and reflections affect signal propagation and power transfer efficiency. By simulating real-world scenarios, the project highlights the critical importance of impedance matching, signal stability, and electromagnetic compatibility in ensuring optimal performance of high-frequency and satellite communication systems. Furthermore, it demonstrates the application of mathematical modeling and computational tools for the design, analysis, and optimization of RF and microwave networks, bridging theoretical electromagnetics with modern engineering practices. This work ultimately showcases how simulation-based learning enhances understanding of complex electromagnetic behaviors and supports the development of robust, interference-free communication infrastructures.
